                <p>Throghout my life, I have always loved shoes. Both me and my family have noticed my love for shoes. When I was much younger, RackRoom was one of my favorite places to go to with my parents. I would always point out a pair of shoes I was intrested in; Chuck Taylor Converse shoes were my favorite shoes that I had at the time. Overtime, my hype for shoes had just kept on growing and growing. I am at a time where my maturity is evolving, and that I start to develop skills and new ways of thinking. As a result, shoes became my intrest and my lifestyle. Collecting had started not too long ago; I got my very first pair of Jordans when I was in the 6th grade. Over the years, I learn more and more about sneakers. I went from a kid with $60 cheap-quality tennis shoes to a kid with limited, hyped, and top-notch sneakers other sneakerheads would wish to have. I am thankful for where I am and what I have today, and that I can do what I love.</p>
