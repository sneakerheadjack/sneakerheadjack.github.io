                <p>Throghout my life, I have always loved shoes. Both me and my family have noticed my love for shoes. When I was much younger, RackRoom was one of my favorite places to go to with my parents. I would always point out a pair of shoes I was intrested in; Chuck Taylor Converse shoes were my favorite shoes that I had at the time. Overtime, my hype for shoes had just kept on growing and growing. I am at a time where my maturity is evolving, and that I start to develop skills and new ways of thinking. As a result, shoes became my intrest and my lifestyle. Collecting had started not too long ago; I got my very first pair of Jordans when I was in the 6th grade. Over the years, I learn more and more about sneakers. I went from a kid with $60 cheap-quality tennis shoes to a kid with limited, hyped, and top-notch sneakers other sneakerheads would wish to have. I am thankful for where I am and what I have today, and that I can do what I love.</p>

                 <h1>Who is SneakerHeadJack?</h1>         
                 <p>My name is Jack Highsmith, and I am a shoe collector.</p>
                         </div>
                 <p>I live in North Carolina, and I have been living there for my whole life; same house, same furniture, same people. I live in a nice neighborhood with nice people. I live in a pretty nice home, and sleep in a pretty nice room. I guess you could say my live is pretty nice.</p> 
                 <p>I am currently in Highschool and I don't have any spacific plans for my future. I only have some "could-do's" or "want-to-do's", such as musical arts. </p>
                 <p>I have always loved sneakers. Ever sense I was a little boy, shoes were one of my small intrests that I had. It has even been documented since I was three-years-old that I have liked shoes. Now, of course, my mom bougt all of my sneakers when I was that age. Usually, she would pick out shoes for me. Then, as I got older, I started to take an intrest and choose my own shoes to wear. I would choose things from Converse, Nike, Adidas, and ,sometimes, even those strange off-brand sneakers. I would always comeare my sneakers to other kid's sneakers, and sometimes I would get excited if I saw someone wearing the same shoes as me. Obviously, based on my past, I have always been true to the sneaker culture.</p>
